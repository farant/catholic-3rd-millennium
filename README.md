# Catholic Third Millennium

### What are computers good for?

* Computer software is really new.
* Basically the past 30 years have been an experiment to see what happens when we make different kinds of software.
* The creation of software has been driven by greed and ego.
* We live in a mostly materialistic society with a mechanistic view of reality
  * For the most part our society can't even concieve of spirit let alone spiritual good. 
  * The minority that believe in some kind of "spiritual reality" are primarily pagans that are inflicting spiritual harm out of ignorance or malice
* You can make infinite copies of digital software or media for basically free. This is practically and economically unprecedented.
* The internet allows communication and geographically independent social cohesion not equivalent to physical proximity but greater than anything previously available.
* What are the key, unique use cases of software:
  * Video recording and distribution
  * Record based databases
  * Graph based databases
  * Change ledgers
  * Reminders
  * Interactive simulations
  * Encoding domain knowledge
  * Cheap or free reading material
  * Automated language translation
  * A global "public square"
  * Creating digital illustrations
  * Creating animations
  * Typewriters with infinite paper
  * Extremely space efficient document storage
  * Generative illustrations
  * Always available "large language models" for practice learning foreign languages
  * Broadcast communication / one-to-many (text, audio or video)
  * Forum communication / many-to-many (text, audio or video)
  * Conversations / one-on-one communication (text, audio or video)
  * ...?


### Un(der)explored Opportunities

* Explicitly Catholic software 
* Beauty (modern society doesn't believe in objective beauty)
* Building software with humility and prioritizing good at the expense of profit motive
* Pagination instead of scrolling
* Grayscale computers instead of color
* Alternative internet protocols and clients that are disconnected from the "world wide web"
* Private or family scale "social networks"
* Explicitly multi-generational software projects with commensurate levels of planning
* Software based on document files instead of centralized online databases
* Plastic software designed to empower users to easily change or extend it
* Computers that are not connected to the internet
* Ambient sounds and sound effects when you interact with things
* Important software that is not designed by committee 

### Open Questions

* Is it possible for computers and the internet to be used in a positive way?
* Are there proper uses for machine learning models or are there inherent inescapable disorders?


### What are society wide problems?

* People going to Heaven
* Serving and loving the Holy Trinity
* Deeply-rooted and confusing demonic heresies that people don't know how to extract themselves from
* General lack of virtue
* Raising future generations of good priests
* Abortion
* Population collapse
* Ignorance of history
* Extreme pressures and disorder in the family
* Disproportionate influence of malevolent groups of actors
* Lack of coordination to build and maintain beneficial infrastructure
* Society-wide communication about and understanding of the truth
* Social polarization and hostility 
* Homelessness and poverty / dysfunctional industrialized "charity"
* Catechizing
* Ugliness
* Learned helplessness
* Christian unity
* Addressing social vulnerabilities to prevent future collapses of society (i.e. the "enlightenment")
* Poorly designed social systems that do not take advantage of modern technologies
* Honorable stewardship of what God has given us


### Ideas for software

* Digital "family book" tools for families to pass on knowledge and purpose to future generations
* Historical timelines
* An actual all catholic twitter
* Operational / organizational software for collaboration on catholic projects
* An interactive "catechism" with very high production values
* A interactive graph of syllogisms and dependencies between syllogisms for people to navigate debates
* A central hub that kind of describes and maps out the Catholic online / media landscape
* Tools to create community for geographically dispersed catholics
* Software for learning latin / greek / hebrew
* Catholic youtube
* Tools for handling the operational aspect of different vocations
* Tools to train people to have careers as programmers
* Catholic operating system with limitations designed to encourage computers to have an appropriate place in people's lives
* Alternative Catholic "internet" again with design limitations to avoid unhealthy uses
* Tools for subsidiarity organization / city states
* Interactive well-illustrated Catholic encyclopedia
* Tools for studying, recording and sharing quotes from books
* Free tools to empower and teach people regarding tasks common to every family or small business, such as budgeting, accounting, meal planning, keeping track of bills, recurring tasks, etc.
* A file format for building homeschool curriculums and sharing pieces or all of them easily with others
* Some kind of Catholic payment platform that allows people to request and offer financial assistance (also perhaps to request and recieve other kinds of assistance, similar to the St Vincent de Paul Society?)
* ???

1. What is the material nature of government?
1.1. You can describe law and government as a "human system"
1.1.1. Why is it a "human" system?
1.1.1.1. Because human beings are the driving force that animate the system
1.1.2. Does the system only incorporate humans?
1.1.2.1. No, the system incorporates (i.e. responds to and affects in varying degrees) 
         every element of the geographic region in which the system is operational
1.1.3. What is a system

2. Are all human systems categorizable as governments?
2.1. No, there are many human systems that are not governments

3. What is the distinguising quality of a "government" that distinguishes it from other
   kinds of human systems?
3.1. The distinguishing quality of a government is a that it is larger than a family and
     it exercises the function of creating laws with the ability to enforce those laws 
     through physical power.

4. Is it more perfect or less perfect for governments to overlap geographically?
4.1. It is less perfect for governments to overlap geographically

5. Is it more perfect for a government to be geographically large or geographically small?
5.1. The most perfect size of a government is relatively small geographic region 
     containing ~50,000-100,000 people
5.1.1. Why is a government incorporating ~100,000 people more perfect?
5.1.1.1. Because larger than that size people within the human system cannot sustain 
         personal relationships with eachother
5.1.1.2. Because larger than the implied geographical size lawmakers and law enforcers 
         begin to be too physically isolated from the "on the ground reality" that their
         decision making is affecting.

6. Do we live in a world of mostly perfect governments?
6.1. No, we live in a world of very imperfect governments.
6.1.1. Almost every government in the world is far too large

7. What are the negative consequences of imperfect governments?
7.1 Imperfect governments are ripe for demonic manipulation

8. Why are imperfect governments ripe for demonic manipulation?
8.1. Demons generally are able to succeed at severely corrupting a small number of 
     people, succeed at moderately corrupting a moderate number of people, and succeed 
     at lying to a great number of people.
8.2. In a human system are the inviduals demons target for severe corruption distributed 
     at random?
8.2.1. No, in a human system demons will specifically target the individuals with the 
       greatest power to warp the system towards evil
8.3. In a more imperfect government (i.e. a "larger" government) individuals targeted for 
     severe corruption have the potential to exercise evil over a greater number people 
     with less natural checks that would be available to correct or remove that individual 
     from power as there would be in a more perfect government.

9. What is the purpose of the special powers that government has relative to other 
   human systems?
9.1. A government exists to mediate between its citizens and families as well as it can 
     to protect them from the negative affects of fallen human nature, demonic corruption 
     and to resolve disputes between individuals when these functions cannot be 
     accomplished by any other human system.

10. Do imperfect governments only use their special powers for their intended purposes?
10.1. No, one of the primary ways that imperfect governments are distorted as a system 
      is to wield their special power in ways that are outside of the scope of their 
      special purpose.
10.1.1. Are all cases of a government using its special powers outside of their scope due 
        to demonic corruption?
10.1.1.1. No, this distortion of government can also be caused by fallen human nature or 
          by well-intentioned individuals trying to use the powers of government to 
          accomplish some kind of good.
10.1.2. If a government's powers are used to accomplish an objective moral good that is 
        outside of the natural scope of the government's purpose is that act morally good?
10.1.2.1. No, it is not morally good due to the principal of the integral good. Disordered
          means lead to disordered outcomes.
