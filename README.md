# Catholic Third Millennium

### What are computers good for?

* Computer software is really new.
* Basically the past 30 years have been an experiment to see what happens when we make different kinds of software.
* The creation of software has been driven by greed and ego.
* We live in a mostly materialistic society with a mechanistic view of reality
  * For the most part our society can't even concieve of spirit let alone spiritual good. 
  * The minority that believe in some kind of "spiritual reality" are primarily pagans that are inflicting spiritual harm out of ignorance or malice
* You can make infinite copies of digital software or media for basically free. This is practically and economically unprecedented.
* The internet allows communication and geographically independent social cohesion not equivalent to physical proximity but greater than anything previously available.
* What are the key, unique use cases of software:
  * Video recording and distribution
  * Record based databases
  * Graph based databases
  * Change ledgers
  * Reminders
  * Interactive simulations
  * Encoding domain knowledge
  * Cheap or free reading material
  * Automated language translation
  * A global "public square"
  * Creating digital illustrations
  * Creating animations
  * Typewriters with infinite paper
  * Extremely space efficient document storage
  * Generative illustrations
  * Always available "large language models" for practice learning foreign languages
  * Broadcast communication / one-to-many (text, audio or video)
  * Forum communication / many-to-many (text, audio or video)
  * Conversations / one-on-one communication (text, audio or video)
  * ...?


### Un(der)explored Opportunities

* Explicitly Catholic software 
* Beauty (modern society doesn't believe in objective beauty)
* Building software with humility and prioritizing good at the expense of profit motive
* Pagination instead of scrolling
* Grayscale computers instead of color
* Alternative internet protocols and clients that are disconnected from the "world wide web"
* Private or family scale "social networks"
* Explicitly multi-generational software projects with commensurate levels of planning
* Software based on document files instead of centralized online databases
* Plastic software designed to empower users to easily change or extend it
* Computers that are not connected to the internet
* Ambient sounds and sound effects when you interact with things
* Important software that is not designed by committee 

### Open Questions

* Is it possible for computers and the internet to be used in a positive way?
* Are there proper uses for machine learning models or are there inherent inescapable disorders?


### What are society wide problems?

* People going to Heaven
* Serving and loving the Holy Trinity
* Deeply-rooted and confusing demonic heresies that people don't know how to extract themselves from
* General lack of virtue
* Raising future generations of good priests
* Abortion
* Population collapse
* Ignorance of history
* Extreme pressures and disorder in the family
* Disproportionate influence of malevolent groups of actors
* Lack of coordination to build and maintain beneficial infrastructure
* Society-wide communication about and understanding of the truth
* Social polarization and hostility 
* Homelessness and poverty / dysfunctional industrialized "charity"
* Catechizing
* Ugliness
* Learned helplessness
* Christian unity
* Addressing social vulnerabilities to prevent future collapses of society (i.e. the "enlightenment")
* Poorly designed social systems that do not take advantage of modern technologies
* Honorable stewardship of what God has given us


### Ideas for software

* Digital "family book" tools for families to pass on knowledge and purpose to future generations
* Historical timelines
* An actual all catholic twitter
* Operational / organizational software for collaboration on catholic projects
* An interactive "catechism" with very high production values
* A interactive graph of syllogisms and dependencies between syllogisms for people to navigate debates
* A central hub that kind of describes and maps out the Catholic online / media landscape
* Tools to create community for geographically dispersed catholics
* Software for learning latin / greek / hebrew
* Catholic youtube
* Tools for handling the operational aspect of different vocations
* Tools to train people to have careers as programmers
* Catholic operating system with limitations designed to encourage computers to have an appropriate place in people's lives
* Alternative Catholic "internet" again with design limitations to avoid unhealthy uses
* Tools for subsidiarity organization / city states
* Interactive well-illustrated Catholic encyclopedia
* Tools for studying, recording and sharing quotes from books
* Free tools to empower and teach people regarding tasks common to every family or small business, such as budgeting, accounting, meal planning, keeping track of bills, recurring tasks, etc.
* A file format for building homeschool curriculums and sharing pieces or all of them easily with others
* Some kind of Catholic payment platform that allows people to request and offer financial assistance (also perhaps to request and recieve other kinds of assistance, similar to the St Vincent de Paul Society?)
* ???



### Ideas for government

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InlbmbGxOK0

(work in progress, my understanding of thomistic stuff is not super deep yet so there's probably stuff i'm not specifying correctly ðŸ˜¬ I do think there are some important things to consider taking into account modern internet / software)

```
1. What is the material nature of government?
1.1. You can describe law and government as a "human system"
1.1.1. Why is it a "human" system?
1.1.1.1. Because human beings are the driving force that animate the system
1.1.2. Does the system only incorporate humans?
1.1.2.1. No, the system incorporates (i.e. responds to and affects in varying degrees) 
         every element of the geographic region in which the system is operational
1.1.3. What is a system?
1.1.3.1. A system is a complex group of interacting parts that as a whole is directed 
         towards specific purposes.

2. Are all human systems categorizable as governments?
2.1. No, there are many human systems that are not governments.
2.1.1. Examples include: the Church, the family, businesses, religious communities and 
       volunteer groups.

3. What is the distinguishing quality of a "government" that delineates it from other
   kinds of human systems?
3.1. The distinguishing quality of a government is that it is larger than a family and
     it exercises the function of creating laws with the ability to enforce those laws 
     through physical force.

4. Is it more perfect or less perfect for governments to overlap geographically?
4.1. It is less perfect for governments to overlap geographically

5. Is it more perfect for a government to be geographically large or geographically small?
5.1. The most perfect size of a government is a relatively small geographic region 
     containing no more than ~50,000-100,000 people

6. How can we categorize the ways a government can be imperfect?
6.1. We can classify the imperfections of a government as either imperfections of scope,
     structure or governing.
     
7. What are the imperfections of scope?
7.1. Being too geographically large is an imperfection of scope.
7.2. Incorporating too many people is an imperfection of scope.

8. What are the imperfections of structure?
8.1. A disordered relationship to Christ's church.
8.2. A disordered relationship to the sovereign family.
8.3. Lack of ability to exercise force
8.4. Lack of ability to legislate laws when needed
8.5. Lack of ability to adjudicate

9. What are the imperfections of governing? 
9.1. Governing can be imperfect due to immoral law.
9.2. Governing can be imperfect due to abuse of its ability to exercise force.
9.3. Governing can be imperfect if it fails to enforce the law.
9.5. Governing can be disordered if it tries to achieve goods outside of its
     natural purpose.
9.6. Governing can be imperfect if it fails to adapt its laws prudently to
     to the practical realities in which it governs.

10. Do we live in a world of mostly perfect governments?
10.1. No, we live in a world of very imperfect governments.
10.1.1. Almost every government in the world is imperfect in scope.
10.1.2. Almost every government in the world is imperfect in structure
        regarding their relationship to Christ's church and their relationship
        to the sovereign family.
10.1.3. Every government in the world is imperfect in every aspect of governing
        with perhaps a few exceptions.

11. What are the negative consequences of imperfect governments?
11.1. Imperfections of scope, i.e. governments larger than 100,000 people, lead 
      to many negative consequences.
11.1.1. There is a greater capacity for harm when leaders fall prey to moral 
        corruption or act imprudently out of ignorance.
11.1.2. It is difficult to correct immoral leaders due to the greater total power
        available to the government.
11.1.3. People leading the government cannot sustain sufficient personal relationships 
        with the governed.
11.1.4. If the government is too large geographically then lawmakers and law enforcers
        begin to be physically isolated from the consequences of their activities.
11.2. Imperfections of structure lead to imperfections of governing.
11.3. Imperfections of governing are intrinsically harmful.

12. Are governments that are imperfect in scope more ripe for demonic manipulation?
12.1. Probably not.
12.2. The larger the government the greater the material temptations that will be
      presented to those in positions of power and therefore if left to their own
      devices the greater the chance that they will fall into a state of mortal sin.
12.2.1. The risk of leaders falling into mortal sin and inviting demonic manipulation
        applies to all human systems, not just governments, if the power of leadership
        also accrues economic or social prestige.
12.3. Ironically this risk is also why God permits greater demonic attacks on
      individuals in leadership positions.
12.3.1. This is not because demons have agency and are intelligently choosing the
        most "high value" targets (although it can present the illusion of this 
        being the case) but because leaders face greater risk of mortal sin
        and God wants to help them.
12.3.2. God provides greater perfection to the leader to resist mortal sin through
        perfectly tempered allowance of demonic activity that can be carefully
        modulated to never exceed what they can bear.
12.3.3. The individual is actually much safer while under demonic attack since
        demons are completely subject to God's authority. This is in contrast to 
        beind scandalized by human free will which God does not directly restrain.

13. What is the purpose of the special powers that government has relative to other 
    human systems?
13.1. A government exists to mediate between its citizens and families as well as to 
      protect them from the negative affects of fallen human nature, of demonic corruption 
      and to resolve disputes between individuals when these functions cannot be 
      accomplished by any other human system.

14. Do imperfect governments only use their special powers for their intended purposes?
14.1. No, one of the primary ways that imperfect governments are distorted as a system 
      is to wield their special power in ways that are outside of the scope of their 
      special purpose.
14.1.1. Are all cases of a government using its special powers outside of their scope due 
        to demonic corruption?
14.1.1.1. No, this distortion of government can also be caused by fallen human nature or 
          by well-intentioned individuals trying to use the powers of government to 
          accomplish some kind of good.
14.1.2. If a government's powers are used to accomplish an objective moral good that is 
        outside of the natural scope of the government's purpose is that act morally good?
14.1.2.1. No, it is not morally good due to the principal of the integral good. Disordered
          means lead to disordered outcomes.
          
15. Is physical force the only kind of force that can be applied in a human system?
15.1. No, there are seven kinds of force that can be applied in a human system.
15.1.1. Physical force
15.1.2. Exclusion from the sacraments (exercised by the Church via its special powers)
15.1.3. Economic force
15.1.4. Truth
15.1.5. Beauty
15.1.6. Witness
15.1.6.1. Witness means that an individual is aware their behavior is being observed.
15.1.6.2. The force of witness is proportional to the virtue of the observers.
15.1.7. Natural authority

16. Why are the seven human system forces considered forces?
16.1. Because they can be directed to compel the behavior of a man against his will.

17. Can you categorize the seven human system forces?
17.1. Yes. Forces can be categorized as "harmful" or "non-harmful"
17.1.1. Physical force, exclusion from the sacraments and economic force are harmful 
        forces because their application always harms their object.
17.1.2. Truth, beauty, witness and natural authority are non-harmful because their 
        application never harms a human object and in fact works some good.
       
18. Are the harmful or non-harmful forces more perfect?
18.1. The non-harmful forces are more perfect because while harmful forces can compel
      the exterior behavior of man the non-harmful forces can compel his inner nature.

19. Is it possible to resist the non-harmful forces?
19.1. Yes it is possible to resist the non-harmful forces but it requires a
      disordered will.
19.1.1. The stronger the non-harmful force the stronger must be the disordered will
        to resist.

20. Is it common for people to have strong disordered wills?
20.1. No, most people have disordered wills that are weak.
20.1.1. To have a strong disordered will one must most explicitly set oneself against
        God. This is not common because it causes pain to do so and because most people 
        do not exercise substantial control over their beliefs.
20.1.1.1. All demons have strong disordered wills.

21. Do demons attempt to gain control over human systems that can apply harmful force?
21.1. Yes, demons will always attempt to gain control over human systems that apply
      harmful force.
     
22. Do demons attempt to gain control over human systems that apply non-harmful force?
22.1. No, demons will not attempt to control systems that apply non-harmful force
      because the non-harmful forces of Truth, Beauty, Witness and Natural Authority
      always work some good and are therefore incompatible with demonic ends. 
22.2. Instead demons will attempt to destroy the system and replace it with a system
      that is impotent and generates the inverse of the non-harmful forces: Lies, 
      Ugliness, Secrecy and Rebellion
22.2.1. Lies, Ugliness, Secrecy and Rebellion are impotent because they lack the ability
        to compel man's exterior behavior or his inner nature against his will (the will
        must co-operate for them to effect a change).
    
23. If we are subject to a gravely imperfect government do we have an obligation to 
    correct its disorders?
23.1. Yes.

24. If we are aware of a gravely imperfect government but are not subject to its
    power do we have an obligation to correct its disorders?
24.1. Yes. 
24.1.1. We have an obligation out of charity
24.1.2. We have an obligation to other members of the body of Christ
24.1.3. We are bound by our love for Jesus who died for the salvation of every soul.

25. How are the disorders of a government corrected?
25.1. Roughly speaking a government is reflective of the faction of the population
      holding the majority of power in regards to the seven human forces.
25.1.1. Often this faction does not hold numerical majority due to concentration
        of power in harmful forces, i.e. physical and economic force.
25.1.2. The measure of power is the sum of all the harmful and non-harmful forces
        available to the faction.
25.2. If the faction holding the majority of power becomes less disordered then the
      government will become less disordered.
25.3. If a less disordered faction gains the majority of power the government will
      change to reflect the less disordered faction.
      
26. How can the disorder of a ruling faction be corrected?
26.1. Generally through the application of the four non-harmful forces.
26.1.1. The non-harmful forces are most effective because of their ability to
        compel the human interior, i.e. the stronghold of moral disorder.
        
27. Is it easy to change disorder through the application of non-harmful forces?
27.1. It depends on if the disorder is moral or intellectual.
27.2. Moral disorder is hard to change.
27.2.1. Generally moral disorder is caused by fallen human nature or by some level 
        of demonic manipulation.
27.2.2. Similar to an exorcism the pressure of non-harmful forces to compel moral 
        order must be constant and strong.
27.2.3. Similar to an exorcism application of non-harmful forces to moral disorder
        will generally provoke displays of resistance.
27.2.3.1. Displays of resistance tend to peak immediately preceding victory unless 
          the power of non-harmful force is overwhelming in strength.
27.2.3.2. Displays of resistance are meant to disrupt the application of non-harmful
          forces by invoking fear, doubt or confusion.
27.3. Intellectual disorder is relatively easy to change with the proper resources.
27.3.1. Intellectual disorder is either caused by lies or ignorance
27.3.1.1. Ignorance is easier to change than lies.
27.3.1.2. Lies tend to ultimately have a demonic origin.
27.3.2. The key resources required to correct intellectual disorder are truth and
        understanding of the truth.
27.3.2.1. Often people who are not intellectually disordered possess truth without
          understanding of the truth.
27.3.2.1.1. When one possesses truth without understanding of the truth you are
            vulnerable to intellectual disorder via lies.
27.3.2.1.1.1. There is a demonic "anti-theology" (gnosticism, manichaeism, etc.) 
              that one can trace through its various historical manifestations
              that is specifically tailored to lead people who possess truth 
              without understanding of the truth into intellectual disorder.
27.3.2.1.1.2. It is extremely important for culture to develop and preserve 
              understanding of the truth.
27.3.2.1.1.3. Materially novel situations such as technological breakthroughs are
              particularly fraught with potential for intellectual disorder
              because understanding of the truth has not yet been developed.
