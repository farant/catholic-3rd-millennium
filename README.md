# Catholic Third Millennium

### What are computers good for?

* Computer software is really new.
* Basically the past 30 years have been an experiment to see what happens when we make different kinds of software.
* The creation of software has been driven by greed and ego.
* We live in a mostly materialistic society with a mechanistic view of reality
  * For the most part our society can't even concieve of spirit let alone spiritual good. 
  * The minority that believe in some kind of "spiritual reality" are primarily pagans that are inflicting spiritual harm out of ignorance or malice
* You can make infinite copies of digital software or media for basically free. This is practically and economically unprecedented.
* The internet allows communication and geographically independent social cohesion not equivalent to physical proximity but greater than anything previously available.
* What are the key, unique use cases of software:
  * Video recording and distribution
  * Record based databases
  * Graph based databases
  * Change ledgers
  * Reminders
  * Interactive simulations
  * Encoding domain knowledge
  * Cheap or free reading material
  * Automated language translation
  * A global "public square"
  * Creating digital illustrations
  * Creating animations
  * Typewriters with infinite paper
  * Extremely space efficient document storage
  * Generative illustrations
  * Always available "large language models" for practice learning foreign languages
  * Broadcast communication / one-to-many (text, audio or video)
  * Forum communication / many-to-many (text, audio or video)
  * Conversations / one-on-one communication (text, audio or video)
  * ...?


### Un(der)explored Opportunities

* Explicitly Catholic software 
* Beauty (modern society doesn't believe in objective beauty)
* Building software with humility and prioritizing good at the expense of profit motive
* Pagination instead of scrolling
* Grayscale computers instead of color
* Alternative internet protocols and clients that are disconnected from the "world wide web"
* Private or family scale "social networks"
* Explicitly multi-generational software projects with commensurate levels of planning
* Software based on document files instead of centralized online databases
* Plastic software designed to empower users to easily change or extend it
* Computers that are not connected to the internet
* Ambient sounds and sound effects when you interact with things
* Important software that is not designed by committee 

### Open Questions

* Is it possible for computers and the internet to be used in a positive way?
* Are there proper uses for machine learning models or are there inherent inescapable disorders?


### What are society wide problems?

* People going to Heaven
* Serving and loving the Holy Trinity
* Deeply-rooted and confusing demonic heresies that people don't know how to extract themselves from
* General lack of virtue
* Raising future generations of good priests
* Abortion
* Population collapse
* Ignorance of history
* Extreme pressures and disorder in the family
* Disproportionate influence of malevolent groups of actors
* Lack of coordination to build and maintain beneficial infrastructure
* Society-wide communication about and understanding of the truth
* Social polarization and hostility 
* Homelessness and poverty / dysfunctional industrialized "charity"
* Catechizing
* Ugliness
* Learned helplessness
* Christian unity
* Addressing social vulnerabilities to prevent future collapses of society (i.e. the "enlightenment")
* Poorly designed social systems that do not take advantage of modern technologies
* Honorable stewardship of what God has given us
